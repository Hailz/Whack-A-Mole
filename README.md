Your app must:

    Display a game in the browser
    Switch turns between two players, or switch turns between a player and the computer (AI)*
    Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
    Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
    Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
    Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
    Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it**
    Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


For my project I used HTML, CSS, and jQuery. For my approach I started by figuring out what graphics I could find for free online and how I could make them work with my game. I had to figure out how to build my game map and how to remove the backgrounds of the pictures I planned to use. I then progressed to further build the visual layout of my game and started work on how to make the zombies appear and disappear. The most challenging part was probably adding the "Kapow" images when the zombies are hit. I wanted to show two different approaches to making images appear and disapear, one with the images built into the HTML and one with them added later through jQuery. Adding sounds to the game was also interesting but I had fun with it.

As far as I'm aware everything works as it should. I already got to do everything I wanted to do with my game though I was starting to think about adding something that you shouldn't click in the higher levels. I'm still toying with the idea though and debating what I would have pop up instead of zombies.
